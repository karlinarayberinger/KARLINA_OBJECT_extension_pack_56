How wide is a photon?

ChatGPT:

A photon doesn’t have a single, well-defined “width” the way a ball or a grain of sand does.

Why: In physics a photon is a quantum of the electromagnetic field. What you can meaningfully talk about is its wavelength and the spatial extent of its wavepacket (how spread out its quantum state is), not a rigid geometric diameter.

What people usually mean by “wide”

1) Wavelength (λ)

This sets the scale of the photon’s oscillation pattern and limits how tightly light of that color can be focused. Roughly, you can’t squeeze a photon into a spot much smaller than on the order of its wavelength (more precisely, diffraction gives a limit on the order of ~λ/2 with ideal optics).

Examples:

Visible light: λ ≈ 400–700 nm (nanometers)

Radio: λ can be meters to kilometers

Gamma rays: λ can be smaller than an atomic nucleus

2) Beam spot size / focus size

If you shine “single photons” through a laser-like beam, the beam might be millimeters wide, microns wide, etc. That width is a property of the optical mode / beam, not an intrinsic photon size.

3) Wavepacket length (along the direction of travel)

A photon with a very precise frequency (very narrow bandwidth) is spread out over a long distance; a photon in a short pulse is localized. This depends entirely on how it was produced.

Bottom line

A photon has no fixed physical width. Its “size” depends on the quantum state you prepare (wavelength + how localized the wavepacket is), and on the measurement setup.

If you tell me what context you mean (focused spot size? wavelength? “particle diameter”?), I can give a more specific answer.

karbytes:

What is the rate at which photons flow per finite-dimensional three-dimensional space volume in a laser beam?

ChatGPT:

There isn’t one universal “rate” for all laser beams — it depends on the beam’s power, the photons’ energy (i.e., wavelength), and how concentrated the beam is in space. But there is a clean physics quantity for what you’re asking:

Photon flow rate density (photon flux density)

If you mean “photons per second per unit area” (how many photons cross a surface each second), the standard measure is:

If you tell me the laser power, wavelength, and beam diameter (or area), I can plug in numbers for your specific case.

karbytes:

How about the laser which reads and/or writes data on optical discs?

ChatGPT:

Sure. Optical-disc pickup lasers are typically near-infrared (CD) or red (DVD) or violet (Blu-ray), and the power depends a lot on read vs write.

Below are reasonable ballpark photon-flow numbers.

Practical interpretation

Even though an optical drive laser is “low power” in everyday terms, it produces:

~quadrillions of photons per second when reading

~hundreds of quadrillions+ per second when writing

extremely concentrated flux because the spot is sub-micron

If you want, tell me CD/DVD/Blu-ray, read or write, and a power estimate (or drive model), and I’ll compute a tighter numeric range.

karbytes:

What is heavier: one hundred photons or one photon?

ChatGPT:

One hundred photons is heavier (has more mass-equivalent) than one photon, assuming they all have the same frequency.

Photons have zero rest mass, but they do carry energy, and energy contributes to inertia/gravity via

E = m * c^2

So the “effective mass” is

m_eq = E / c^2

For 1 photon: 

m_eq = hν / c^2

For 100 photons: 

m_eq = 100 * (hν / c^2)

So 100 photons have 100× the energy, and therefore 100× the mass-equivalent, and would (in principle) gravitate 100× as much.

karbytes:

Are photons fundamentally comprosed of energy? Are electrons, neutrons, and protons composed of pure energy?

ChatGPT:

“Energy” isn’t a substance that things are made of in modern physics. It’s a property (a conserved quantity) that physical systems have. So it’s a bit misleading to say something is “composed of energy,” even though mass and energy are closely related.

Photons

A photon is a quantum excitation of the electromagnetic field. It carries energy E = hν and momentum, but it is not “made of energy” like energy is a material. It’s better to say: a photon is a particle of light whose defining properties include energy and momentum.

Electrons

An electron is an excitation of the electron field (a fundamental quantum field). It has a rest mass m_e, charge, spin, etc. You can convert an electron and a positron into photons (annihilation), and you can create electron–positron pairs from enough photon energy. That shows energy can become particles and particles can become other particles, but it still doesn’t mean the electron “is made of energy” in a literal material sense.

Protons and neutrons

Protons and neutrons are not fundamental: they’re made of quarks and gluons (QCD).

Importantly, most of a proton’s (or neutron’s) mass is not from the bare masses of the quarks. A large fraction comes from:

the energy of the quarks’ motion,

the energy stored in gluon fields,

and QCD binding/field energy.

So in that sense, a lot of the mass of protons/neutrons is energy in the fields and dynamics. But again: that’s still “energy as a property of the interacting quantum fields,” not “pure energy stuff.”

Bottom line
Photons: not “made of energy,” but they carry energy and are excitations of a field.

Electrons: fundamental particles with rest mass; not “pure energy,” though they can be created from energy.

Protons/neutrons: composite particles whose mass is largely from interaction/field energy inside them.

If you want, I can quantify it: e.g., roughly how much of a proton’s mass comes from quark rest masses vs QCD energy.

karbytes:

Do photons require space in order to exist? Do they require time to exist?

ChatGPT:

In standard physics, yes: photons require spacetime (space and time) in order to be meaningfully said to “exist” or “propagate.”

But it’s worth being precise about what that means.

Do photons require space?

A photon is an excitation of the electromagnetic field, and that field is defined throughout space (more precisely, throughout spacetime). A photon’s quantum state has a location/momentum distribution, and it propagates from one region to another.

So in ordinary physics, no space → no place for the field → no photon in the usual sense.

Also: “photon” is defined by properties like wavelength, momentum direction, polarization, and propagation — those ideas assume spatial structure.

Do photons require time?
Yes, because “a photon exists” is not just a static fact — it has a state that evolves and a history: emission, propagation, absorption.

Even if you tried to imagine a frozen instant with no time passing, you’d lose the meaning of “propagation” and “frequency” (frequency literally means oscillations per unit time).

So in ordinary physics, no time → no dynamics → no photon behavior.

Important subtlety: photon “proper time”
Photons experience zero proper time along their path (in relativity). That sometimes gets paraphrased as “a photon doesn’t experience time.”

But that does not mean photons don’t require time to exist in the universe. It means that the photon’s own “clock” doesn’t tick (you can’t ride along with a photon in a valid inertial frame).

Observers in the lab do measure the photon taking time to travel:

t = d / c

Bottom line
Photons require space in the sense that they are field excitations that are defined on spacetime and propagate through space.

Photons require time in the sense that emission/propagation/absorption and even “frequency” only make sense with time.

Even though photons have zero proper time, they still exist in spacetime and are described using time by every physical observer.

If you want, I can also answer this from a “what if spacetime is emergent?” viewpoint, but that moves into more speculative physics.

karbytes:

Yes please!

ChatGPT:

Alright — but fair warning: once you ask “what if spacetime is emergent?”, we leave settled textbook physics and move into research-level ideas. None of this is confirmed, but there are a few coherent ways people think about it.

The core idea: “photon” might not be fundamental

In emergent-spacetime views, space and time are not the deepest layer. Instead, they arise from something more basic (information, quantum entanglement structure, algebraic relations, discrete networks, etc.).

In that case, a “photon” might also be not fundamental. It could be an emergent excitation that only looks like “a particle moving through space” once spacetime itself has appeared.

So the question “does a photon require space/time?” becomes:

Does the deeper system support the kind of excitation that looks like a photon once spacetime emerges?

In many approaches, the answer is effectively yes: photons “exist” only in the emergent regime where “space” and “time” are meaningful.

1) Photons as emergent excitations of an underlying quantum system

In condensed-matter physics, you can get emergent gauge fields and “photon-like” excitations in materials (not literal real photons, but mathematically similar behavior). This is a good analogy:

The crystal lattice is the deeper structure

The “photon” is a collective mode

The “space” the mode propagates through is tied to the lattice geometry

So emergent-spacetime thinking says: maybe our universe is like that, but at a deeper level.

Takeaway: photons may not exist “before space”—they are phenomena of the spacetime phase.

2) Spacetime emerging from entanglement (“geometry from quantum information”)

One popular theme is that the shape of spacetime is related to patterns of entanglement.

In that view:

“Distance” between regions might correspond to how strongly they’re entangled or connected.

“Photon travel” might correspond to how an excitation propagates through that entanglement network.

Then asking “does the photon need space?” becomes:

A photon needs a connectivity structure (something like adjacency / causal links).

That connectivity is what we call space at large scales.

So photons require ‘space’ only because ‘space’ is the name for the relationships that make propagation possible.

3) Time as emergent: “change” without fundamental time

Time is harder than space. Some approaches suggest there is no fundamental flowing time; instead:

the universe is described by a static global quantum state, and

“time” is an emergent bookkeeping concept tied to correlations between subsystems.

In that view, a photon doesn’t “move through time” fundamentally. Instead:

there exist correlations such that if a detector clicks “later,” it is consistently related to an emitter event “earlier.”

So the photon may be more like:

a consistent pattern connecting two events in the relational structure,
rather than a tiny marble traveling on a timeline.

Takeaway: photons may not require fundamental time, but they require some underlying notion of order / causality / correlation that plays the role time plays for us.

4) Causality is the real minimum requirement

Even if “space” and “time” are emergent, most physics still needs something like:

“this can influence that”

“information cannot propagate arbitrarily”

“some events can be earlier/later in a partial ordering”

That’s basically causal structure.

A photon is deeply tied to the idea of:

signals

light cones

maximum propagation speed

So even in emergent models, “photon-ness” usually requires:

a causal structure that approximates relativistic light cones.

5) A practical way to say it

In emergent-spacetime perspectives:

A photon is not “something inside space and time.”

A photon is a pattern in the underlying substrate that, when described in emergent spacetime language, behaves like a massless particle traveling at c.

So:

Do photons require space to exist?
Not necessarily as a fundamental ingredient, but they require whatever deeper structure gives rise to spatial relations.

Do photons require time to exist?
Not necessarily as a fundamental flowing parameter, but they require whatever deeper structure gives rise to causality / temporal ordering.

The grounded conclusion
If spacetime is emergent, then “photon” likely is too — and photons “exist” mainly as effective entities inside the emergent spacetime description.

So the safest statement is:

Photons don’t require fundamental space and time if those aren’t fundamental — but they require the deeper relational/causal structure from which space and time arise.

If you want, I can connect this to specific frameworks (loop quantum gravity/spin networks, causal sets, AdS/CFT-style ideas, or “it from qubit” viewpoints) in a non-handwavey way.
