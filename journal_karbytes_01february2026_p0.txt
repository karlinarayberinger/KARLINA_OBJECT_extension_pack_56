On 01_FEBRUARY_2026 karbytes updated its cloud-hosted multi-track MP3 player web application (both the light-web GitHub-hosted version and the dark-web personal-server version) with some additional black-metal sound tracks so that karbytes (and other users) of that application can listen to multiple sound tracks simultaneously for indefinitely many iterations each.

(Before today's update of that web application, the last time that web application was updated was on 14_NOVEMBER_2025).

Note that each of the sound tracks (or audio files) which is featured in any web page of karbytes (including interactive JavaScript-powered web applications) is available as an MP4 file somewhere in the RAW_GITHUB_FILES_MACRO_DIRECTORY section of the Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com website.
