<p>The Unwritten Disc<br />
A Unit of Freedom<br />
Holding Superpositions</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>I generally try to keep some blank M_DISC optical discs in stock in my personal storage room so that I can make an archival-grade copy of data I decide is worth preserving &#8220;last minute&#8221;.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Another &#8220;random&#8221; thought which has been circulating through my mind today is the hypothetical possibility of humans being able to &#8220;read minds&#8221; of humans other than themselves via bypassing apparent &#8220;laws of physics&#8221; which seem to precisely describe the simulated universe humans live inside of and tapping into more fundamental properties of that &#8220;holographic projection&#8221; to achieve telepathy, time travel, and magical transformations; maybe even true immortalization of apparently mortal entities such as human minds (i.e. human egos).</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>A thought I had in relation to what I said in the previous paragraph is that perhaps allegedly unbreakable logical rules of physics (as humans know them) become inconsistent (and hence meaninglessness) at some resolution scopes within the larger &#8220;ruliad-like structure&#8221; which is reality. What I&#8217;m trying to say in a more concise format is that <span style="background:#00ffff">perhaps physics only describes some types of localized phenomena but not all types of &#8220;simultaneous&#8221; phenomena (due to the fact that &#8220;laws of physics&#8221; applies specifically to exactly one scope (even with multiple frames of reference within it) instead of to some other &#8220;concurrent&#8221; (within &#8220;The Ruliad-like Superposition Of All Superpositions&#8221;) scope which diverges &#8220;too much&#8221; in terms of spatial or temporal distance to the extent of essentially being a separate universe even if both scopes started as the same universe (but eventually diverged away from each other due to the space in that universe expanding due to vacuum energy driving indefinite increase in cosmic structures (and of whole universes))).</span></p>
